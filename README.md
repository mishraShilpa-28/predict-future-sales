# Predict Future Sales

## Overview
This project is a time-series forecasting model that predicts future sales based on historical data. It was developed for the **Kaggle Predict Future Sales** competition. The model leverages machine learning techniques, including feature engineering and gradient boosting, to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Implementation of machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Visualization of results  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharmaroshan/Predict-Future-Sales.git
   cd Predict-Future-Sales


2. Install dependencies:
   bash
   Copy
   Edit
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore and train the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle's Predict Future Sales competition. It includes sales data from a Russian software company.

## Usage
- Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare data.
- Train the model using the provided training scripts.
- Evaluate and visualize results.
